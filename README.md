# ReziWebsite

Welcome to the [Rezi.one](https://www.rezi.one) github! This is the second iteration of the Rezi Project after the [Rezi Bot](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi) broke, instead of using a discord interface, it is now in a website.

*Latest (3/15/2022) = v1.0.0*

# Website = [rezi.one](https://rezi.one)

# When will the full release be available?
Released 3/15/2022 for full use. Thank you.

# What about the Rezi Bot?
[Rezi Bot](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi) is finally available, and it relies on the Rezi Website instead of using it's own search engine.

# What is this?
This is the second iteration of the Rezi Project after the [Rezi Bot](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi) broke. This site basically does everything the Rezi Bot did except it runs on a website and is much faster. I will explain all of it in the wiki if interested. For those who haven't used the Rezi Bot, **this site basically scrapes links from game sites and puts them all into a file for your searching convenience. Every 24 hours, the bot scrapes links from an input text file, and then puts it all into a json, which is then converted to a table and puts into an html.**

# Piracy
Yes. But there will be a non-piracy version for searching through links from sites such as steam, or gog, or nintendo where you can search for where to buy, not as useful, but for those against piracy or uncomfortable with it, it will be introduced later. For now, "Yes". **As a reminder, this site will never host any content other than just links, so it will never be taken down for piracy for any reason, and as it is open-source, anybody could start their own site using the same principles if they wanted.** 

# For instructions on use and code please look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/wiki).
This site is pretty straight forward all on its own and doesn't need much instruction, but for those interested in the code and all of its functions, that will be there too. There, I will be going into the nitty gritty of the code and explaining everything.

# How can I help?
Good question! If you would like to help you can either donate (helps me out a lot) or you can wait until I fully release the code, and add your own. I will also implement website requesting (propably in the discord) as it is relatively easy to go implement. Also, if you find a problem, please report it in the issues tab in this [github](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/issues/new/choose) so I can fix it!
