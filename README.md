# ReziWebsite

Welcome to the [Rezi.one](https://www.rezi.one) github! This is the second iteration of the Rezi Project after the [Rezi Bot](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi) broke, instead of using a discord interface, it is now in a website. This site basically does everything the Rezi Bot did except it runs on a website and is much faster. For those who haven't used the Rezi Bot, **this site basically scrapes links from game sites and puts them all into a file for your searching convenience. Every 24 hours, the bot scrapes links from an input text file, and then puts it all into a json, which is then sent to the database to search from.**

# Website = [rezi.one](https://rezi.one)
Here you can freely search and download games that are always updated and available for you, 100% free. 

# What about the Rezi Bot?
[Rezi Bot](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi) is finally available, and it relies on the Rezi Website instead of using it's own search engine. You can use it by either adding it to your own server (has limited spots available), [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=796909768940978186&permissions=3072&scope=bot), or by joining my own server where I also put out updates and other fun things, [here](https://discord.gg/47SnjxgBFb).

# Piracy
Yes. But there will be a non-piracy version for searching through links from sites such as steam, or gog, or nintendo where you can search for where to buy, not as useful, but for those against piracy or uncomfortable with it, it will be introduced later. For now, "Yes". **As a reminder, this site will never host any content other than just links, so it will never be taken down for piracy for any reason, and as it is open-source, anybody could start their own site using the same principles if they wanted.** 

# For instructions on use and code please look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/wiki).
This site is pretty straight forward all on its own and doesn't need much instruction, but for those interested in the code and all of its functions, that will be there too. There, I will be going into the nitty gritty of the code and explaining everything.

# How can I help?
